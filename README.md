## 🛠️ Prerequisites for Implementation

### Required MCP Servers
1. **Playwright MCP**: Browser automation for Zoom access
2. **Confluence MCP**: Wiki page creation
3. **AI Assistant**: Claude, GPT, or similar for content analysis

### System Requirements
- **OS**: macOS (optimized), Linux/Windows (compatible)
- **Node.js**: For Playwright MCP server
- **Docker**: For Confluence MCP server
- **Access**: Zoom recordings and Confluence wiki

## 🚀 Quick Start - 3-Step Process

### Step 1: Copy the AI Prompt Template
```markdown
3 steps to execute. Here is the URL [PASTE_ZOOM_URL_HERE]
Passcode: [PASTE_PASSCODE_HERE]

- Using Playwright MCP, download the Audio Transcript file from to Temp Files folder
- Summarize the transcript content to an easily readable Meeting notes with distinct sections for Attendees, Date, Discussion Points and Action items. Also include a section for recording and include the URL provided above in this section 
- Output this meeting notes to a new wiki page in the personal space of mathewba
```

### Step 2: Customize for Your Meeting
- **Replace `[PASTE_ZOOM_URL_HERE]`** with your Zoom recording share URL
- **Replace `[PASTE_PASSCODE_HERE]`** with the meeting passcode
- **Customize sections** based on meeting type (see templates below)

### Step 3: Execute and Get Results
- **Paste into Claude/Cursor** with MCP servers configured
- **Wait 5 minutes** for complete automation
- **Get professional meeting notes** with instant wiki page creation

## 📋 Meeting Note Templates

### 🏗️ Technical Architecture Review
```markdown
- Summarize the transcript content to a readable Meeting notes with sections for Attendees, Date, Technical Decisions, Architecture Choices, Implementation Timeline, Risks and Mitigation, and Action items. Also include a section for recording and include the URL I provided above in this section
```

### 📅 Project Planning Meeting
```markdown
- Summarize the transcript content to a readable Meeting notes with sections for Attendees, Date, Project Scope, Timeline, Resource Requirements, Dependencies, Risks, and Action items. Also include a section for recording and include the URL I provided above in this section
